Qtcord is a Discord client built with Qt aiming to bring a lightweight, native experience. I am not responsible if you get your account banned from this project.

## Notes for developers
Check out [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/mak448a/Qtcord/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)!
> [!NOTE]
> You need Python 3.12 or higher!
> Also, I recommend using uv if you have it installed. It's faster than pip. (`uv pip install -r requirements.txt`)

Do the standard Python procedure:
`python3 -m venv venv`
`source venv/bin/activate`
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Cd into src
`cd src/`

Afterwards, just run main.py. If you're on Windows, substitute `python3` for `python`.
```shell
python3 main.py
```
